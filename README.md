# ChatGPT-Powered EDA & Model Explanation Visualization

## Project Overview

This project harnesses the capabilities of **ChatGPT** to automatically generate Python code for visualizing data through various **graphs** and **charts**. The primary objective is to assist users in conducting **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and interpreting **model training outputs**, specifically focusing on elucidating reasons why certain features may not be effectively captured during model training.

By utilizing natural language queries, users can interact with ChatGPT to obtain Python scripts that produce visual representations, thereby facilitating a deeper understanding of data patterns and model performance.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language Interaction:** Enables users to pose questions regarding their dataset or model performance, with ChatGPT responding by generating appropriate Python code for data visualization.

- **EDA Graph Generation:** Facilitates the creation of various graphical representations such as histograms, scatter plots, pair plots, and correlation heatmaps to examine data distributions, feature relationships, and identify potential data anomalies.

- **Model Training Visualizations:** Produces visual outputs including loss curves, feature importance charts, confusion matrices, and classification reports to analyze model performance and identify areas of improvement.

- **Model Limitation Explanations:** Focuses on generating visualizations that highlight reasons for suboptimal feature capture in models, such as multicollinearity, data imbalance, or the presence of noisy data.

## Usage

To utilize this project, please adhere to the following steps:

### 1. Install Dependencies

Ensure that all necessary Python libraries are installed. Execute the following command to install required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
###  2. Submit a Query to ChatGPT
Users may submit inquiries such as:

"How can I visualize the correlation between features in my dataset?"
"Show me the distribution of feature X and explain why it might not be picked up by the model."
"Generate a confusion matrix for my classification model and explain the results."

### 3. Execute the Generated Python Code
Upon receiving the Python code from ChatGPT, copy and paste it into your Python environment and execute it. The script will generate the requested visualizations.


## Example Use Cases
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
User Query:

```
User input: How can I visualize the relationship between feature A and feature B?
```

Backend of ChatGPT:
```
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assuming df is your DataFrame
sns.scatterplot(x='Feature_A', y='Feature_B', data=df)
plt.title('Scatter Plot of Feature A vs Feature B')
plt.show()
```

Model Training Output
User Query:

```
User input: Why is feature C not contributing well in my model?
```

Backend of ChatGPT:
```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Assuming 'model' is a trained model with feature importance attributes
feature_importances = model.feature_importances_
sns.barplot(x=feature_importances, y=df.columns)
plt.title('Feature Importance')
plt.show()

# Additional insights about multicollinearity:
sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title('Correlation Heatmap')
plt.show()
```
This code assists in visualizing the significance of Feature C by displaying its importance and assessing its correlation with other features.

## Significance of the Project
Understanding the underlying reasons for a machine learning model's inability to effectively utilize certain features is pivotal for enhancing model performance. This project offers the following benefits:

* Data Pattern Visualization: Illustrates data distributions and relationships to explain feature irrelevance.
* Issue Identification: Detects problems such as multicollinearity or class imbalance that may lead to model bias or misinterpretation.
* Enhanced Model Insights: Provides visual tools for deeper analysis of model behavior, facilitating better debugging and optimization.

## Project Roadmap
### Phase 1: Initial Setup

* Develop foundational integration for ChatGPT to generate Python code for graph creation.
* Support basic EDA visualizations including scatter plots, histograms, and box plots.

### Phase 2: Advanced Model Insights

* Incorporate support for sophisticated model visualizations such as feature importance, confusion matrices, and loss curves.
* Implement explanations for common model-related issues, including overfitting and data leakage.

### Phase 3: User Customization
Enable user customization of the generated Python code, allowing modifications to plot styles and the selection of specific features.
